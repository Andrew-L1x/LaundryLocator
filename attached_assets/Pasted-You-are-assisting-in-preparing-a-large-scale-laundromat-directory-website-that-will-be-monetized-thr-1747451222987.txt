You are assisting in preparing a large-scale laundromat directory website that will be monetized through ads, premium listings, and affiliate links. Your task is to enrich the provided CSV data with SEO-optimized content and useful metadata for each laundromat. The data was extracted from Google Maps using Outscraper and includes columns like name, address, phone, hours, rating, etc.

🎯 Enrich Each Row with the Following:

1. SEO Tags (Comma-Separated)

Add tags based on any keyword clues in the name, website, categories, or description fields. Choose from:

24 hour, drop-off, coin laundry, self-service, pickup, delivery, open late, eco-friendly, cheapest, full-service

Example logic:
	•	If hours include “Open 24 hours” → add 24 hour
	•	If name or categories include “Coin” → add coin laundry
	•	If working hours end past 9PM → add open late
	•	If “pickup” or “delivery” appear in site/description → tag accordingly

2. Short Summary (100–150 characters)

Write a user-friendly summary for each business that highlights hours, services, or reputation. Use this in the card UI.
	•	Examples:
	•	“Clean self-service laundromat with drop-off available. Open daily 6AM–10PM.”
	•	“Affordable coin laundry with high ratings and friendly staff. Free Wi-Fi available.”

3. Default Description (Optional, 300–400 characters)

If description is missing, write one based on location, services, and ratings. Focus on helping the user choose this laundromat.

4. Premium Score (0–100)

Assign a score based on how “premium” the listing looks:
	•	+30 for having a photo
	•	+10 for having a logo
	•	+10 for website present
	•	+20 if rating ≥ 4.5
	•	+10 if review count > 200

This will be used to determine default featured listings.

🔄 Output Format (CSV or JSON)

Add these 4 new fields to the existing structure:
	•	seo_tags
	•	short_summary
	•	default_description
	•	premium_score

Make sure to return the full dataset with all original columns and the new enriched ones added.
